Code -> Build -> Test -> Push

Problem? Code is merged but not integrated, which means developers push code several times in a day and when all the code is build together it throws conflicts, bugs, errors.

Solution? Build code from VCS after every commit. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
Developers push code changes frequently (daily or multiple times a day).
Each push triggers an automated pipeline:
Pull code from GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
Build/compile the project (e.g., with Maven, Gradle).
Run tests (unit tests, integration tests).
Check quality (linting, code coverage, SonarQube).
ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Catch bugs early and ensure all code integrates smoothly.

CI Process : Developers -> VCS -> Fetch -> Build -> Test -> Notify -> Developers
