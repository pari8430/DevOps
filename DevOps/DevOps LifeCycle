The DevOps lifecycle is a structured approach that integrates development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to streamline software delivery. It focuses on collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback across key phases planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring executed in a continuous loop.

7 Cs of DevOps 
The 7 Cs of DevOps are core principles that help make DevOps successful. They guide how teams work together, build, test, and deliver software faster and more reliably. Each of these Cs contributes to a workflow that enhances the quality, speed, and reliability of delivering software products:

1. Continuous Development :
Continuous Development involves the iterative and incremental approach to software creation, where development teams plan, code, and prepare software features in small, manageable units. This methodology enables rapid feedback, early detection of issues, and swift delivery of value to end-users. It integrates closely with version control systems and automation tools to streamline the development process.

2.Continuous Integration :
Continuous Integration (CI) in DevOps ensures that code changes made by developers are automatically built, tested, and integrated into the main codebase. This process typically involves four key stages:
1. Source Code Management (SCM): Developers push their code from local machines to a remote repository such as GitHub. This allows teams to collaborate, review, and manage code versions easily.
2. Build Process: The source code is then compiled using tools like Maven, which packages the application into artifacts such as .jar, .war, or .ear files.
3. Code Quality Check: Tools like SonarQube analyze the code for bugs, code smells, and security issues. It generates detailed reports (HTML or PDF) to maintain code quality standards.
4. Artifact Repository: The generated build artifacts are stored in a repository manager like Nexus, which serves as a central storage for future deployment.
All these steps are automated using Jenkins, a popular CI tool that orchestrates the complete flow, from fetching code to storing the final build artifact.

3. Continuous Testing :
Continuous Testing means testing the code automatically every time there is a change. This helps catch bugs early before the app goes live. With DevOps and Agile methods, companies can use tools like Selenium, Testsigma, or LambdaTest to test their applications automatically. These tools run tests faster and smarter than manual testing.
Using a tool like Jenkins, we can set up the entire testing process to run automatically after every code change. This saves time and reduces human errors.

4. Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery :
Continuous Deployment: Continuous Deployment is the process of automatically deploying an application into the production environment when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we'll automate everything from obtaining the application's source code to deploying it.
Continuous Delivery: Continuous Delivery is the process of deploying an application into production servers manually when it has completed testing and the build stages. Here, we will automate the continuous integration processes, however, manual involvement is still required for deploying it to the production environment.

5. Continuous Monitoring :
DevOps lifecycle is incomplete if there was no Continuous Monitoring. Continuous Monitoring can be achieved with the help of Prometheus and Grafana we can continuously monitor and can get notified before anything goes wrong with the help of Prometheus we can gather many performance measures, including CPU and memory utilization, network traffic, application response times, error rates, and others. Grafana makes it possible to visually represent and keep track of data from time series, such as CPU and memory utilization.

6. Continuous Feedback :
Once the application is released into the market the end users will use the application and they will give us feedback about the performance of the application and any glitches affecting the user experience after getting multiple feedback from the end users' the DevOps team will analyze the feedbacks given by end users and they will reach out to the developer team tries to rectify the mistakes they are performed in that piece of code by this we can reduce the errors or bugs that which we are currently developing and can produce much more effective results for the end users also we reduce any unnecessary steps to deploy the application. Continuous Feedback can increase the performance of the application and reduce bugs in the code making it smooth for end users to use the application.

7. Continuous Operations :
We will sustain the higher application uptime by implementing continuous operation, which will assist us to cut down on the maintenance downtime that will negatively impact end users' experiences. More output, lower manufacturing costs, and better quality control are benefits of continuous operations.

Popular DevOps Lifecycle Tools :
1. Plan
Tools: Jira, Trello, Asana
Used for task planning, assignment, and progress tracking.

2. Develop
Tools: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
Enables version control, code collaboration, and branching.

3. Build
Tools: Jenkins, Maven, Gradle
Automates the process of compiling code and managing dependencies.

4. Test
Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, SonarQube
Conducts automated testing for bugs, code quality, and security vulnerabilities.

5. Release/Deploy
Tools: ArgoCD, GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, Spinnaker, Terraform
Automates deployment pipelines and software releases.

6. Operate
Tools: Terraform, Ansible, Puppet, Chef
Handles infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

7. Monitor
Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog
Tracks performance, logs, metrics, and system health.
