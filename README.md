# 🚀 DevOps Journey – Learning in Public

Welcome to my DevOps learning journal!  
This repository documents my week-by-week journey as I explore DevOps from the ground up — one concept, tool, and challenge at a time.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

I believe in **learning in public** — sharing what I learn, the problems I face, and how I solve them.  
This repo helps me:
- Track my progress
- Reflect on my learning
- Share insights and real-world examples
- Connect with others on the same journey

## 🗓️ Weekly Structure

From **Monday to Thursday**, I learn new topics, experiment with tools, and solve real-world scenarios.  
On **Thursday evenings**, I:
- Push related code/projects here
- Write a blog post on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)
- Reflect on 3 things I learned + issues I faced

Every **Friday**, I share a summary on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) with all relevant links.
