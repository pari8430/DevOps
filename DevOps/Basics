DevOps is a combination of two words: "Development" and "Operations." Itâ€™s a modern approach where software developers and software operations teams work together throughout the entire software life cycle, from planning and coding to testing, deploying, and monitoring.

The main idea of DevOps is to improve the software delivery process. We achieve this by software release automation, continuous monitoring/logging and testing. The goals of DevOps are:
Faster and continuous software releases.
Reduces manual errors through automation.
Built-in Monitoring, detect failures or issues during delivery or in production.
Automate testing throughout the software delivery process.


Stages of DevOps are:

Build Stage
1. Developers write and organize code, using version control tools like Git to track changes.
2. The system automatically compiles and packages the code into a deployable format.
3. Dependencies (external libraries and tools) are included to ensure smooth operation.
4. Common Tools: Git, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Gradle, Maven.

Test Stage
1. The software undergoes thorough testing to catch bugs and security risks before release.
2. Different testing methods include:
Unit Testing: Checks individual pieces of code.
Integration Testing: Ensures different parts of the system work together.
Performance Testing: Measures speed and scalability.
Security Testing: Identifies potential vulnerabilities.
3. Automated tests help ensure the software is stable before moving forward.
4. Common Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, SonarQube.

Release Stage
1. The software is deployed in a staging environment to simulate real-world conditions.
2. If everything checks out, the software is rolled out to production using deployment strategies like:
Blue-Green Deployment: Two identical environments switch traffic for a seamless update.
Canary Deployment: A small percentage of users get the new version first, ensuring safety.
Rolling Updates: The update is gradually pushed out to all users.
3. Common Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm, ArgoCD.

Continuous Feedback Loop
A key aspect of DevOps is learning from real-world performance and using that feedback to improve future releases.

Monitoring & Logging: Track system performance and detect errors.
User Feedback: Gather insights from customers to enhance features.
Incident Response: Alert systems notify teams of failures for quick fixes.
Process Improvement: Teams analyze past releases to optimize automation and workflow.
Common Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog, New Relic.
